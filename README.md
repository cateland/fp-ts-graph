# fp-ts-graph

Immutable, functional graph data structure for fp-ts.

The graph is directed and cyclic. The latter property will change in future to acyclic. Currently we don't check for cycles on insertion.

# Install

```bash
npm install fp-ts fp-ts-graph
```

# JavaScript Example

```js
const graph = require("fp-ts-graph");
```
